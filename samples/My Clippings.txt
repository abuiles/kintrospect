This spread of money’s first two components—the idea of a universally applicable unit of value and the practice of keeping accounts in it—reinforced the development of the third: the principle of decentralised negotiability. The new idea of universal economic value made possible the offsetting of obligations without reference to a centralised authority. And the new idea of an objective economic space created the confidence that this possibility would exist indefinitely. Markets require people to be able to negotiate a sale or agree a wage on their own, instead of feeding their preferences into a central authority in order to receive back a directive on how to act.

It had its own system of accounting—the rules of book-keeping set out in Pacioli’s De Arithmetica, and the standard protocols agreed between the great merchant houses for applying it.

There was no question that the impending Irish famine was an economic disaster and a human tragedy. But simply sending aid was absolutely the wrong way to help. It would violate two central principles of economic theory. The first was the need to avoid moral hazard. Send aid, and one might alleviate the immediate problem—but at the cost of reducing the Irish to a state of permanent dependency. The second was the hallowed principle of non-intervention in the operation of the market. Adam Smith had proved that it was allowing private self-interest to operate as freely as possible that most efficiently achieves the social good. For the government to interfere with the operation of the market in solving the crisis would therefore be a foolish error.

Aristotle adduced the story of Midas as the mythical expression of nominalism: the fact that economic value is a social contrivance rather than a natural property. Monetary wealth, he argued, differs from an abundance of real, useful, physical things like food or firewood precisely in this respect: it only has value—indeed, it can only exist—in society. Take away its social context and one would quickly discover that money is wealth “of such a kind that a man may be well supplied with it and yet die of hunger, like the famous Midas in the legend.”10

life. And once these ideas have been admitted, the rest follows automatically. Since there is no intrinsic limit to economic value, there is no fixed point of reference in monetary society. It is from this set of ideas that the constant imperialism of markets, the ceaseless carousel of status competition, and the insatiability of the desire for money flow. From this prognosis of the inevitable consequences of allowing money free rein flowed the Greeks’ conclusion that far from being a viable—even an ideal—mode of organising society, money was in fact self-contradictory.

Competition between companies in a market is absolutely nothing like competition between jurisdictions on tax. Think about it like this: If a company cannot compete it may fail and be replaced by another that provides better and cheaper goods or services. This “creative destruction” is painful, but it is also a source of capitalism’s dynamism. But what happens when a country cannot “compete?” A failed state? That is a very different prospect. Nobody would, or could, as Mitchell put it, “shut down New Hampshire.” What does it actually mean for a country to be “competitive”? Governments obviously do not “compete” in any meaningful way to police their streets. They do, perhaps, compete to educate their citizens better, but this kind of “competition” points to higher taxes to pay for better education.

Property rights, as the philosopher Martin O’Neill points out, emerge from a general system of legal and political rules that includes the rules of taxation. To say tax is theft, then, is to use a system of which tax is a central part as your weapon against taxation. It is to argue in an illogical circle.

Flowing time has shifted as well. In the first era, tasks were accomplished in batch mode. You got your bills every month. Taxes were all paid on the same day of the year. Telephone service came only in units of 30 days. Items piled up and were dealt with in batches. Then, in the second age, along came the web, and very quickly we expected everything the same day. If we withdrew money from our bank, we expected the deduction to show up in our account that same day, not at the end of the month. If we sent an email, we expected a reply later in the day, not two weeks later, like regular mail. Our cycle time jumped from batch mode to daily mode. This was a big deal. The expectation shifted so fast, many institutions were caught off guard. People ran out of patience waiting to be sent a form they needed to fill out; if they couldn’t fill it out that day, they moved on.

Now in the third age, we’ve moved from daily mode to real time. If we message someone, we expect them to reply instantly. If we spend money, we expect the balance in our account to adjust in real time. Why should medical diagnostics take days to return results instead of immediately? If we take a quiz in class, why shouldn’t the score be instant? For news, we demand to know what is happening this very second, not an hour ago. Unless it occurs in real time, it does not exist. The corollary—and this is important—is that in order to operate in real time, everything has to flow.

The switch from “ownership that you purchase” to “access that you subscribe to” overturns many conventions. Ownership is casual, fickle. If something better comes along, grab it. A subscription, on the other hand, gushes a never-ending stream of updates, issues, and versions that force a constant interaction between the producer and the consumer. It is not a onetime event; it’s an ongoing relationship. To access a service, a customer is often committing to it in a far stronger way than when he or she purchases an item. You often get locked into a subscription (think of your mobile phone carrier or cable provider) that is difficult to switch out of. The longer you are with the service, the better it gets to know you; and the better it knows you, the harder it is to leave and start over again. It’s almost like being married. Naturally, the producer cherishes this kind of loyalty, but the customer gets (or should get) many advantages for continuing as well: uninterrupted quality, continuous improvements, attentive personalization—assuming it’s a good service.

It’s hard to find the right form of an idea, a form that will let consumers see its value, understand how to interact with it, and feel excited enough to pay for it. That is so hard that it often takes a team of people to do it. And that’s when the level of hard goes even higher.

Sales can talk about who they’ve closed, Customer Service can talk about customers they’ve rescued, Business Development shares deals. This have several benefits. One, you start to feel like you are part of a pretty special winning team. Two, the team starts looking forward to having something to share. They seek wins. And lastly, the company starts to appreciate what each discipline is going through and understands what everyone does all day.

In addition to reading words on a page, we now read words floating nonlinearly in the lyrics of a music video or scrolling up in the closing credits of a movie. We might read dialog balloons spoken by an avatar in a virtual reality, or click through the labels of objects in a video game, or decipher the words on a diagram online. We should properly call this new activity “screening” rather than reading. Screening includes reading words, but also watching words and reading images. This new activity has new characteristics. Screens are always on; we never stop staring at them, unlike with books. This new platform is very visual and it gradually merges words with moving images. On the screen words zip around and float over images, serving as footnotes or annotations, linking to other words or images. You might think of this new medium as books we watch or television we read.

Some scholars of literature claim that a book is really that virtual place your mind goes to when you are reading. It is a conceptual state of imagination that one might call “literature space.” According to these scholars, when you are engaged in this reading space, your brain works differently than when you are screening. Neurological studies show that learning to read changes the brain’s circuitry. Instead of skipping around distractedly gathering bits, when you read you are transported, focused, immersed.

Book reading strengthened our analytical skills, encouraging us to pursue an observation all the way down to the footnote. Screening encourages rapid pattern making, associating one idea with another, equipping us to deal with the thousands of new thoughts expressed every day. Screening nurtures thinking in real time. We review a movie while we watch it, or we come up with an obscure fact in the middle of an argument, or we read the owner’s manual of a gadget before we purchase it rather than after we get home and discover that it can’t do what we need it to do. Screens are instruments of the now.

The reason even solid physical goods—like a soda can—can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. The tangible is replaced by intangibles—intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity—that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if they were intangible services. Nouns morph to verbs. Hardware behaves like software. In Silicon Valley they say it like this: “Software eats everything.”

Access mode brings consumers closer to the producer, and in fact the consumer often acts as the producer, or what futurist Alvin Toffler called in 1980 the “prosumer.” If instead of owning software, you access software, then you can share in its improvement. But it also means you have been recruited. You, the new prosumer, are encouraged to identify bugs and report them (replacing a company’s expensive QA department), to seek technical help from other customers in forums (reducing a company’s expensive help desk), and to develop your own add-ons and improvements (replacing a company’s expensive development team). Access amplifies the interactions we have with all parts of a service.

The consequence of moving away from centralized organization to the flatter worlds of networks is that everything—both tangible and intangible—must flow faster to keep the whole going together.

An important aspect of the blockchain is that it is a public commons. No one really owns it because, well, everyone owns it. As a creation becomes digital, it tends to become shared; as it becomes shared, it also becomes ownerless. When everyone “owns” it, nobody owns it. That is often what we mean by public property or the commons. I use roads that I don’t own. I have immediate access to 99 percent of the roads and highways of the world (with a few exceptions) because they are a public commons. We are all granted this street access via our payment of local taxes. For almost any purpose I can think of, the roads of the world serve me as if I owned them. Even better than if I owned them, since I am not in charge of maintaining them. The bulk of public infrastructure offers the same “better than owning” benefits.

For a long time there were two basic ways to organize human work: a firm and a marketplace. A firm, such as a company, had definite boundaries, was permission based, and enabled people to increase their efficiency via collaboration more than if they worked outside the firm. A marketplace had more permeable borders, required no permission to participate, and used the “invisible hand” to allot resources most efficiently. Recently a third way to organize work has emerged: the platform.

A third generation of platforms further expanded the power of the marketplaces. Unlike traditional two-sided markets—say, a farmers’ market that enables buyers and sellers—a platform ecosystem became a multisided market. A good example of this is Facebook. The firm created some rules and protocols that formed a marketplace where independent sellers (college students) produced their own profiles, which were matched up in a marketplace with their friends. The attention of the students was sold to advertisers. Game companies sold to students. Third-party apps sold to advertisers. Third-party apps sold to other third-party apps. And so on in multiple-way matches. This ecosystem of interdependent species keeps expanding, and will keep expanding as long as Facebook can manage its rules and its own growth as a firm.

There is one final step in the inexorable march toward decentralized access. At the same time we are moving to an intercloud we will also move toward one that is fully decentralized and peer to peer. While the enormous clouds of Amazon, Facebook, and Google are distributed, they are not decentralized.

Instead they loaded a tiny app onto their phones called FireChat. Two FireChat-enabled phones could speak to each other directly, via wifi radio, without jumping up to a cell tower. More important, either of the two phones could forward a message to a third FireChat-enabled phone. Keep adding FireChat’d phones and you soon have a full network of phones without towers. Messages that are not meant for one phone are relayed to another phone until they reach their intended recipient. This intensely peer-to-peer variety of network (called a mesh) is not efficient, but it works.

In the late 1990s, activist, provocateur, and aging hippy John Perry Barlow began calling this drift, somewhat tongue in cheek, “dot-communism.” He defined dot-communism as a “workforce composed entirely of free agents,” a decentralized gift or barter economy without money where there is no ownership of property and where technological architecture defines the political space. He was right about the virtual money since the content that Twitter and Facebook distribute is created by unpaid contributors—that is, users like you.

And Barlow was right about the lack of ownership, as explained in the previous chapter. We see sharing economy services such as Netflix and Spotify move audiences away from owning anything. But there is one way in which “socialism” is the wrong word for what is happening: It is not an ideology, not an “ism.” It demands no rigid creed. Rather, it is a spectrum of attitudes, techniques, and tools that promote collaboration, sharing, aggregation, coordination, ad hocracy, and a host of other newly enabled types of social cooperation. It is a design frontier and a particularly fertile space for innovation.

Rather than viewing technological socialism as one side of a zero-sum trade-off between free-market individualism and centralized authority, technological sharing can be seen as a new political operating system that elevates both the individual and the group at once. The largely unarticulated but intuitively understood goal of sharing technology is this: to maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of people working together. Thus, digital sharing can be viewed as a third way that renders irrelevant a lot of the old conventional wisdom.

Some types of collectives benefit from a small degree of hierarchy while others are hurt by it. Platforms like the internet, Facebook, or democracy are intended to serve as an arena for producing goods and delivering services. These infrastructural courtyards benefit from being as nonhierarchical as possible, minimizing barriers to entry and distributing rights and responsibilities equally. When powerful actors dominate in these systems, the entire fabric suffers. On the other hand, organizations built to create products rather than platforms often need strong leaders and hierarchies arranged around timescales: Lower-level work focuses on hourly needs; the next level on jobs that need to be done today. Higher levels focus on weekly or monthly chores, and levels above (often in the CEO suite) need to look out ahead at the next five years. The dream of many companies is to graduate from making products to creating a platform. But when they do succeed (like Facebook), they are often not ready for the required transformation in their role; they have to act more like governments than companies in keeping opportunities “flat” and equitable, and hierarchy to a minimum.

The danger of being rewarded with only what you already like, however, is that you can spin into an egotistical spiral, becoming blind to anything slightly different, even if you’d love it. This is called a filter bubble. The technical term is “overfitting.” You get stuck at a lower than optimal peak because you behave as if you have arrived at the top, ignoring the adjacent environment.

Simon’s insight is often reduced to “In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention.” Our attention is the only valuable resource we personally produce without training. It is in short supply and everyone wants some of it. You can stop sleeping altogether and you will still have only 24 hours per day of potential attention. Absolutely nothing—no money or technology—will ever increase that amount. The maximum potential attention is therefore fixed. Its production is inherently limited while everything else is becoming abundant. Since it is the last scarcity, wherever attention flows, money will follow.

That leaves the big question in an age of cheap plentitude: What is really valuable? Paradoxically, our attention to commodities is not worth much. Our monkey mind is cheaply hijacked. The remaining scarcity in an abundant society is the type of attention that is not derived or focused on commodities. The only things that are increasing in cost while everything else heads to zero are human experiences—which cannot be copied. Everything else becomes commoditized and filterable.

Paul Romer, an economist at New York University who specializes in the theory of economic growth, says real sustainable economic growth does not stem from new resources but from existing resources that are rearranged to make them more valuable. Growth comes from remixing. Brian Arthur, an economist at the Santa Fe Institute who specializes in the dynamics of technological growth, says that all new technologies derive from a combination of existing technologies. Modern technologies are combinations of earlier primitive technologies that have been rearranged and remixed. Since one can combine hundreds of simpler technologies with hundreds of thousands of more complex technologies, there is an unlimited number of possible new technologies—but they are all remixes.

These massive video games are pioneering new ways of interacting. The total interactive freedom suggested by unlimited horizons is illusionary in these kinds of games. Players, or the audience, are assigned tasks to accomplish and given motivations to stay till the end.

Implicit in VR is the fact that everything—without exception—that occurs in VR is tracked. The virtual world is defined as a world under total surveillance, since nothing happens in VR without tracking it first.

The first technological platform to disrupt a society within the lifespan of a human individual was personal computers. Mobile phones were the second platform, and they revolutionized everything in only a few decades. The next disrupting platform—now arriving—is VR.

VR technology offers one more benefit to users. The strong presence generated by VR amplifies two paradoxically opposing traits. It enhances realness, so we might regard a fake world as real—the goal of many games and movies. And it encourages unrealness, fakery to the nth degree.

You, yourself. Your body is your password. Your digital identity is you. All the tools that VR is exploiting, all the ways it needs to capture your movements, to follow your eyes, to decipher your emotions, to encapsulate you as much as possible so you can be transported into another realm and believe you were there—all these interactions will be unique to you, and therefore proof of you.

Degrees of interaction are rising, and will continue to increase. Yet simple noninteractive things, such as a wooden-handled hammer, will endure. Still, anything that can interact, including a smart hammer, will become more valuable in our interactive society. But high interactivity comes at a cost. Interacting demands skills, coordination, experience, and education. Embedded into our technology and cultivated in ourselves. All the more so because we have only begun to invent novel ways to interact. The future of technology resides, in large part, in the discovery of new interactions. In the coming 30 years, anything that is not intensely interactive will be considered broken.

themselves without fooling themselves. Scientific self-tracking was expensive, troublesome, and limited. But in the last few years extremely tiny digital sensors that cost a few pennies have made recording parameters so easy (just click a button), and the varieties of parameters so vast, that almost anyone can now measure a thousand different aspects of themselves

A quantified-self experiment, on the other hand, is just N=1. The subject is yourself. At first it may seem that an N=1 experiment is not scientifically valid, but it turns out that it is extremely valid to you. In many ways it is the ideal experiment because you are testing the variable X against the very particular subject that is your body and mind at one point in time.

Let me give you an example. In 2004, Udo Wachter, an IT manager in Germany, took the guts of a small digital compass and soldered it into a leather belt. He added 13 miniature piezoelectric vibrators, like the ones that vibrate your smartphone, and buried them along the length of the belt. Finally he hacked the electronic compass so that instead of displaying north on a circular screen, it vibrated different parts of the belt when it was clasped into a circle. The section of the circle “facing” north would always vibrate. When Udo put the belt on, he could feel northness on his waist. Within a week of always wearing the north belt, Udo had an unerring sensation of “north.” It was unconscious. He could point in the direction without thinking. He just knew. After several weeks he acquired an additional heightened sense of location, of where he was in a city, as if he could feel a map. Here the quantification from digital tracking was subsumed into a wholly new bodily sensation. In the long term this is the destiny of many of the constant streams of data flowing from our bodily sensors. They won’t be numbers; they will be new senses.

Lifelogging is a hugely wasteful and inefficient process since most of what you lifelog is never used. But like many inefficient processes (such as evolution), it also contains genius. Lifelogging is possible now only because computation and storage and sensors have become so cheap that we can waste them with little cost. But creative “wasting” of computation has been the recipe for many of the most successful digital products and companies, and the benefits of lifelogging also lie in its extravagant use of computation.

The point of lifelogging is to create total recall. If a lifelog records everything in your life, then it could recover anything you experienced even if your meaty mind may have forgotten it. It would be like being able to google your life, if in fact your life were being indexed and fully saved.

“finding defects is actually, frankly, really hard. A lot of times I’ll talk to people about code reviews, and they’ll say, ‘well we did code reviews, but we still had all these bugs’. But they’re not going to catch all the bugs. You’re looking at the diff, and to know exactly how that’s really going to impact your system, you have to know the entire system”.

I don’t negotiate this at all because my feeling is… if they’re being honest with me then they’re going to tell me what they need to be happy with this.

He had the idea to be laid out on his bed, surrounded by family, and to receive visitors as if he was dead. The entire household mourned the passing of its master and the sorrow was only lifted when the crazy loon returned to his normal routine of idle busy-ness.

The time to worry is when the idea is so widely shared that we no longer even notice it, when it is so deeply rooted that it feels to us like plain common sense. At the point when objections are not answered anymore because they are no longer even raised, we are not in control: we do not have the idea; it has us.

short, the current use of rewards is due less to some fact about human nature than to the earlier use of rewards.34 Whether or not we are conscious that this cycle exists, it may help to explain why we have spun ourselves ever deeper into the mire of behaviorism. Here, then, we have a portrait of a culture thoroughly and unreflectively committed to the use of rewards. They offer a temptingly simple way to get people to do what we want. It is the approach we know best, in part because it likely governed how we ourselves were raised and managed. It fits neatly with other institutions and belief systems with which we are familiar. But aside from some troubling questions about the theory of behaviorism, what reason do we have for disavowing this strategy? That is the question to which we now turn.

The belief that rewards will be distributed fairly, even if it takes until the next lifetime to settle accounts, is one component of what is sometimes referred to as the “just world” view. Social psychologists have found that those who hold this position are indeed likely to assume that apparently innocent victims must have done something to deserve their fate; to face the fact that suffering is visited upon innocent people is, of course, to recognize that the world is not particularly just at all. It does not take much imagination to see where this sort of thinking can lead: one group of children, after watching a film about the Nazis, were reported to have said, “But the Jews must have been guilty or they wouldn’t have been punished like that.”1

In short, the equity model, as social psychologist Melvin Lerner put it, “applies to only a limited range of the social encounters that are affected by the desire for justice.”3 Specifically, it is the favored mode of “impersonal, economic relations.”4 To assume that fairness always requires that people should get what they “earn”—that the law of the marketplace is the same thing as justice—is a very dubious proposition indeed.

In the final analysis, they are not one bit less controlling since, like punishments, they are “typically used to induce or pressure people to do things they would not freely do”21—or rather, things that the controller believes they would not freely do. This is why one of the most important (and unsettling) things we can recognize is that the real choice for us is not between rewards and punishments but between either version of behavioral manipulation, on the one hand, and an approach that does not rely on control, on the other.22

Inflating the manipulative features of a reward may make a bad thing worse, but there is no getting around the fact that any time we say “Do this and you’ll get that,” we are attempting to control the behavior of the person we are addressing. Probably all a rewarder can do is minimize—or more disturbing, distract people from noticing—what is really going on.

A far more defensible position, it seems to me, is that some forms of human interaction are controlling and some are not. The line might not be easy to draw in practice, but the distinction is still meaningful and important.

The last objection we might anticipate is that even if it is possible to avoid controlling other people, control is sometimes an appropriate, even desirable, mode of interaction, whether we use rewards or some other technique. It could even be argued that parents who fail to control their children are not living up to their responsibilities.

To devise flexible and reasonable rules for children, preferably by working with them to solve problems rather than imposing these rules on them, is very different from control on the one hand and a laissez-faire approach on the other.

Rewards are often successful at increasing the probability that we will do something. At the same time, though, as I will try to show in this chapter and the two that follow, they also change the way we do it. They offer one particular reason for doing it, sometimes displacing other possible motivations.

Notice that this is not a moral objection; it is a statement of fact about how behavior is easier to control when the organism you are controlling is already dependent on you. In part, this is true because a dependent organism can be kept in a state of need.

At work, people usually continue to get paid for what they do, but if the goal is to help people change their behavior—for example, by improving the quality of their work—a continued dependence on rewards can create a range of practical problems, including an increase in demands (for money rather than M&M’s), as managers trying to implement incentive programs on a permanent basis have discovered.

Translation: when the goodies stop, people go right back to acting the way they did before the program began.

What stands out, though, in any evaluation of the topic is that plans to solve problems by rewarding certain behaviors can only be expected to work for as long as these rewards are still in effect. Moreover, “eliciting desired behaviors is not the only, indeed, not even necessarily the most important outcome of psychotherapy”; what matters more are “the underlying psychological processes,” which behavioral approaches refrain from addressing.16

Miller expected that the boys would do a better job when there was money at stake. Instead, she found that those who were trying to earn the reward made a lot more mistakes than those who weren’t.

Nobody paid much attention to these studies at the time—or since, for that matter. But because most of us assume that better work is done by people who know they are going to be rewarded for doing it, this early research takes on a certain retrospective significance. Those graduate students may not have realized it, but they had stumbled onto something enormously important.

“Do this and you’ll get that” turns out to be bad news whether our goal is to change behavior or to improve performance, whether we are dealing with children or adults, and regardless of whether the reward is a grade, a dollar, a gold star, a candy bar, or any of the other bribes on which we routinely rely. Even assuming we have no ethical reservations about manipulating other people’s behavior to get them to do what we want, the plain truth is that this strategy is likely to backfire.

As one psychologist read the available research, people who are offered rewards tend to choose easier tasks, are less efficient in using the information available to solve novel problems, and tend to be answer oriented and more illogical in their problem-solving strategies. They seem to work harder and produce more activity, but the activity is of a lower quality, contains more errors, and is more stereotyped and less creative than the work of comparable nonrewarded subjects working on the same problems.

As Kurt Lewin, the founder of modern social psychology, recognized, both are used when we want to elicit “a type of behavior which the natural field forces of the moment will not produce.”4 Moreover, the long-term use of either tactic describes the very same pattern; eventually we will need to raise the stakes and offer more and more treats or threaten more and more sanctions to get people to continue acting the way we want.

The whole point is to control people’s behavior, and the most effective way to do this is to describe what will be given to them if they comply—or done to them if they don’t comply.

First, most competition creates anxiety of a type and level that typically interferes with performance.16 Second, those who believe they don’t have a chance of winning are discouraged from making an effort; having been given no reason to apply themselves except to defeat their peers, and convinced that they cannot do so, these people are almost by definition demotivated.17 Third, according to a series of studies by psychologist Carole Ames, people tend to attribute the results of a contest, as contrasted with the results of noncompetitive striving, to factors beyond their control, such as innate ability or luck. The result is a diminished sense of empowerment and less responsibility for their future performance.

The major point here is that whether or not people are offered a direct incentive to wish each other ill, the very fact that they have been led to see themselves as working or learning in order to get something means that they are not very likely to feel well disposed toward others and to put their heads together.23 Some reward programs promote competition and inhibit cooperation more than others do. But to whatever extent they have this effect, the result is ultimately likely to be to the detriment of quality.

The core of behaviorism, on which some decisions to use behavioral strategies are based, is that human beings are no more than what they do. Change what they do and you have dealt with the problem. One writer concisely describes behaviorism as the “confusion of inner motives with their outward expression.”28 But my point is not just that the psychological theory is inadequate; it is that the practice is unproductive. If we do not address the ultimate cause of a problem, the problem will not get solved.

An old joke captures this phenomenon as well as any study could. It is the story of an elderly man who endured the insults of a crowd of ten-year-olds each day as they passed his house on their way home from school. One afternoon, after listening to another round of jeers about how stupid and ugly and bald he was, the man came up with a plan. He met the children on his lawn the following Monday and announced that anyone who came back the next day and yelled rude comments about him would receive a dollar. Amazed and excited, they showed up even earlier on Tuesday, hollering epithets for all they were worth. True to his word, the old man ambled out and paid everyone. “Do the same tomorrow,” he told them, “and you’ll get twenty-five cents for your trouble.” The kids thought that was still pretty good and turned out again on Wednesday to taunt him. At the first catcall, he walked over with a roll of quarters and again paid off his hecklers. “From now on,” he announced, “I can give you only a penny for doing this.” The kids looked at each other in disbelief. “A penny?” they repeated scornfully. “Forget it!” And they never came back again.

The quality of performance in general (as we saw in chapter 3) and of learning in particular (as we’ll see in chapter 8) tend to decline significantly when people are extrinsically motivated.

What rewards do, and what they do with devastating effectiveness, is smother people’s enthusiasm for activities they might otherwise enjoy.

Studies in the 1950s and 1960s found that “lower-class” children, unlike their middle-class counterparts, tended to perform better on certain isolated tasks when given tangible incentives such as candy.20 The reason, some theorists proposed, is that “the ‘extrinsic context’ is more common in lower-income homes.”

Deci, Ryan, and their colleagues argue that a reward for acting in a particular way does two things: it gives us information about what we have done, and it controls (or attempts to control) our future behavior. The more vividly we experience the latter, the more likely that we will lose interest in whatever we are doing. If we are drawing a picture in the hope of getting a prize, or writing a report in order to receive a favorable recommendation, we come to feel that our work is not freely chosen and directed by us; rather, the reward is “pulling” our behavior from the outside. “Intrinsic motivation is the prototypical form of self-determination,”35 while “rewards in general appear to have a controlling significance to some extent and thus in general run the risk of undermining intrinsic motivation.”36

Richard deCharms realized that the truth is quite different: giving someone an extrinsic reason for behaving in a certain way “changes the whole event; it does not just add a reward.”53 The Gestalt has been shifted; the perception of the task and of one’s motives may no longer be what they were. More specifically, the belief that we can offer rewards to jump-start a behavior and then simply fade them out presumes, according to Barry Schwartz, that “the effects of rewards do not carry over beyond acquisition into later occurrences of the activity in question and do not transfer to related, but different activities.”

When we are repeatedly offered extrinsic motivators, we come to find the task or behavior for which we are rewarded less appealing in itself than we did before (or than other people do). Thereafter, our intrinsic motivation having shrunk, we are less likely to engage in the activity unless offered an inducement for doing so. After a while, we appear to be responsive to—indeed, to require—rewards. But it is the prior use of rewards that made us that way!

Regardless of which of these seems to be operating, the evidence suggests that praise “interacts with other variables in a manner analogous to tangible rewards.”23 That means it is a poor bet for enhancing the quality of what people do.

praise again seems to be plagued by exactly the same problems we find with other rewards. Assuming that a child desires the parent’s (or teacher’s) approval, a supportive comment may alter behavior for a while. But it probably will not create a personal commitment to the value in question; in fact, it might actually reduce the likelihood that good behavior will continue when there is no longer anyone around to praise it. In a study of young children published in 1991, Grusec found that those who were frequently praised by their mothers for displays of generosity tended to be slightly less generous on an everyday basis than other children.25

Praise, at least as commonly practiced, is a way of using and perpetuating children’s dependence on us. It gets them to conform to our wishes irrespective of what those wishes are. It sustains a dependence on our evaluations, our decisions about what is good and bad, rather than helping them begin to form their own judgments. It leads them to measure their worth in terms of what will lead us to smile and offer the positive words they crave. Rudolf Dreikurs saw this back in the 1950s: praise, he said, can “lead to a dependency on approval. Overdone, it promotes insecurity as the child becomes frightened at the prospect of not being able to live up to expectations.”30

Praising children for the work they do may discourage self-directed learning, since it is our verbal rewards, and not love of what they are doing, that drive them. Praising children for the way they behave, meanwhile, gives them no reason to continue acting responsibly when no one is likely to say nice things to them after they do so, and it gives them neither the skills nor the inclination to make their own decisions about what constitutes responsible behavior.

But let us return to the fact that not all children react the same way to praise. While utterances that are unmistakably manipulative lead predictably to certain reactions, positive feedback of a more ambiguous sort—the kind that could be perceived either as useful information about one’s performance or as an attempt to control—will probably be interpreted differently depending on who hears

It does not suggest that we ought to hold ourselves back from expressing enthusiasm about what other people have done. It does not imply that we should refrain from making positive comments. Apart from the fact that few of us are about to take such drastic steps regardless of what the data show, my point is that there is no reason we should.

Consider a situation where a large number of people attending a school, working in an organization, or participating in an event are grateful to someone who has worked hard for the benefit of everyone. If thanking that person in public does not seem particularly objectionable, this may be partly because the process of doing so is democratic. By contrast, in the typical ceremony for “recognizing excellence,” the people in charge have unilaterally selected, at their own discretion and based on their own criteria, some people to recognize over, and in front of, others. It is their power to do so that is ultimately being recognized.

Why do most of us respond instead with a barrage of compliments? First, because no thought is necessary to offer them; praise is cheap and easy. By contrast, it takes skill and care and attention to encourage people in such a way that they remain interested in what they are doing and don’t feel controlled. (It is always easier to do things to people, or to take over and do things for them, than it is to work with them to help them make their own decisions.)

These arguments often provoke resistance because they seem to challenge a widespread conviction that all children—indeed, all people—would be better off with more kind words. But when we contemplate the reality of emotionally impoverished families, or the effect of unrelenting criticism, let us keep in mind that the problem in such households is not too little praise.

The trouble with rewards is not that we hand them out too easily; it is that they are controlling, ultimately ineffective, and likely to undermine intrinsic interest. That means they will be counterproductive even when—maybe especially when—they are most clearly contingent on what precedes them. Giving rewards less frequently or more stringently will not solve the underlying problem, because the problem is behaviorism itself.

Again, those who despair of being able to pay the bills often find their thoughts returning to financial matters. But notice how many people, regardless of how they feel about their jobs, or even how much they are paid, are apt to pour their souls into tasks that they pursue in their free time: making music, fixing cars, decorating rooms, puttering in a garden, and of course, tending to their children. This work is often hard and time-consuming, and it is done with no thought of remuneration. Overall, the point is that money isn’t the point.

Furthermore, contests, rankings, and competition for a limited number of incentives cause each employee to see every colleague as an obstacle to her own success, which in turn discourages collaboration and erodes the social support and sense of belongingness that make for secure employees and an effective’ organization.

Excellence pulls in one direction; encouraging employees to think about how well they are doing (and what they will earn as a result) pulls in another.

In the early 1970s, Edward Deci published a paper in a journal of organizational behavior showing that rewarding people for engaging in a task tends to undermine their intrinsic motivation to do it. Because only a few other studies subsequently appeared in such publications,103 some in the field may have assumed this finding was a fluke. But “the research has consistently shown that any contingent payment system tends to undermine intrinsic motivation,”104 even if most of that research has been published in periodicals rarely read by people interested in management.

Deci and his colleagues believe extrinsic motivators have this effect because they are perceived as controlling. Others favor the explanation that “Do this and you’ll get that” automatically devalues the “this”: that is, the task comes to be perceived as a tedious prerequisite for getting a goody.

Whatever the reason for this effect, though, the risk of any incentive or pay-for-performance system is that it will make people less interested in their work and therefore less likely to approach it with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. Furthermore, the more closely we tie compensation (or other rewards) to performance, the more damage we do.

They are offered stickers and stars, edible treats and extra recess, grades and awards. New goodies are substituted as students get older, but the Skinnerian formula follows them.

The more we try to measure, control, and pressure learning from without, the more we obstruct the tendencies of students to be actively involved and to participate in their own education. Not only does this result in a failure of students to absorb the cognitive agenda imparted by educators, but it also creates deleterious consequences for the affective agendas of schools [that is, how students feel about learning]. . . . Externally imposed evaluations, goals, rewards, and pressures seem to create a style of teaching and learning that is antithetical to quality learning outcomes in school, that is, learning characterized by durability, depth, and integration.

Then there is the matter of intrinsic interest. Controlling environments have been shown consistently to reduce people’s interest in whatever they are doing, even when they are doing things that would be highly motivating in other contexts. One study of thirty-five elementary school classrooms, for example, found that children who had controlling teachers displayed lower self-esteem and intrinsic motivation than did those whose teachers supported their capacity to make choices.

Students who are encouraged to think about what they are doing, assuming it is something worth doing, will likely come to find meaning in the processes involved in learning content, value mastery of the content itself, and exhibit pride in craftsmanship. . . . Their focus is on the processes involved in working with the content or performing the skill, and not on themselves, their abilities, how their progress will be perceived by others, or issues of success or failure or reward or punishment.65 This is precisely what we want to promote—partly because a student who is caught up in what he is learning is more likely to be successful in learning it.

The truth is that the problem is not just punishments but also rewards, not bad grades but the emphasis on grading per se. Anything that gets children to think primarily about their performance will undermine their interest in learning, their desire to be challenged, and ultimately the extent of their achievement. Small wonder that rewards have precisely those effects.

the messages that actually come through are these: “Violence is an acceptable way of expressing anger” and “If you are powerful enough you can get away with hurting someone.” For decades, researchers have consistently found that children subjected to physical punishment tend to be more aggressive than their peers, and will likely grow up to use violence on their own children. These effects are not confined to victims of what is legally classified as abuse: even “acceptable” levels of physical punishment may perpetuate aggression and unhappiness.22

The second problem with what might be called the “bank robber argument” is that we want children not to do unethical, hurtful things because they know these things are wrong and because they can imagine how such actions will affect other people. Punishment doesn’t contribute at all to the development of such concerns; it teaches that if they are caught doing something forbidden, they will have to suffer the consequences. The reason not to be a bully is that someone may punch you back; the reason not to rob a bank is that you may go to jail. The emphasis is on what will happen to them.

Children who try to please us by doing what we require so as to obtain what we are dangling in front of them are less likely to ask for help in thinking through problems, or to do anything else that might jeopardize their chances of getting what we are offering. There is a significant difference between developing a caring alliance of openness and trust with children and offering rewards to elicit certain behaviors. The former provides the foundation for helping children reach those long-term goals identified earlier. The latter makes this less likely.

Why Is the Range of 75% to 90% the Standard for Topgrading? Every Topgrader I know has the goal of 100% high performers for their individual team or, from the CEO’s perspective, the entire company. Individual managers have achieved 100% As, but only a couple of companies have (that I know of, and one is a case study in chapter 5) achieved 100% As, and they have less than 100 employees. In previous books 90% As was the cutoff for case studies, because enough leading companies had achieved it to make 90% a high but realistic goal. In this book I lower the cutoff for inclusion to 75% because I don’t know of any CEO or manager who has achieved 75% high performers and then says, “That’s good enough.” And a few of the case studies show less than 75% success because their improvement was nevertheless spectacular or they are just getting into Topgrading, a “work in progress,” sure to improve their results. Even companies with 90% or close to 90% success are not satisfied.

THE NEED FOR TOPGRADING Forgive me, but the following scenario will be repeated throughout the book, just in case a reader might skim certain chapters and miss the fundamental assumptions underlying Topgrading. Managers enter a new job, review their talent, and—I’ve heard this thousands of times in oral case studies—those managers decide they have inherited • 25% high performers and those with high performer potentials; • 50% “okay,” “adequate,” but marginal performers who lack the potential to be high performers and are not as good as others available for the same pay; and • 25% chronic underperformers. Is the glass half empty or half full? If you add 25% high performers to 50% “okay” but not high performers, then you have 75% “okay” or better. That’s the “half full” reality most companies live with. But when it comes to talent, A Players consider that particular glass half empty—75% lack even the potential to be high performers, and that is not good enough.

The simple definition of A Player is “high performer.” Throughout this book I use the terms A Player and high performer interchangeably, but “high performer” is a bit simplistic. As I mentioned, my son Geoff and I created a more complex definition, and it’s worth learning and using in order that you become fully “calibrated,” able to distinguish among A Players and others:

An A Player is “best of class,” in the top 10% of talent available, but what does that mean? “Available” means willing to accept a job offer • at the given compensation level, • in that specific company, with a certain organizational culture (family friendly? dirty politics? fast-paced? Topgraded and growing?), • in that particular industry, • in that location, • with specific accountabilities, • with available resources, and • reporting to a specific person (A Player candidates are more available to you if you are a positive A Player, not a negative C Player).

Topgrading turns the typical hiring logic on its head. Typically, when there is a perceived talent shortfall, Human Resources will be asked to recruit “above the midpoint.” That is, following a job analysis and preparation of a job description, a salary range is established, and rather than aim for the midpoint in the range, the company aims higher, to attract the higher level of talent needed. So, it might target candidates at the seventy-fifth percentile of the salary range. “You get what you pay for” is the rationale.

Trouble is, most companies don’t get what they pay for. With a 75% mis-hire rate, companies are paying for A Players and too often getting B/C Players. Topgrading embraces a different perspective: Regardless of what you pay people, be sure to get top talent for the salary you can afford.

Can A Players Be Incompetent? Yes. One reason could be that you’ve set the compensation too low. Suppose you own an NFL team and you’re crazy enough to set the maximum salary at $25,000. Suppose you nevertheless got 500 applications from guys who are all out of shape and never played football, but applied anyway. No matter what screening system you used, the low pay that only attracted incompetent candidates would assure that you would not hire enough talent to win even one game.

A PLAYERS CAN BECOME B AND C PLAYERS IN FAST-GROWING COMPANIES When the company had $10 million in sales, paying $50,000 for an operations manager was sufficient to attract and hold the necessary A Player talent. The company grew to $100 million in three years. Naturally, mid-managers’ salaries rose. The operations manager job became more complex and the operations manager is paid $100,000, not because he is worth it but because the job is now running three plants and it’s worth paying that much for.

That said, I encourage you to prohibit your managers from taking reference calls, unless they will be giving a reference on an A Player. For reference calls regarding people who were not A Players, ask the caller to contact Human Resources, who should give very limited information. It’s prudent for companies to have that policy because if a manager would say something negative about ol’ Charlie, who was fired for failing to do the job, maybe Charlie would sue (because he’s in a protected class like people over forty), and maybe he’d win.

Is a Business Reference Different from a Personal Reference? Note that we refer to it as a “personal reference call,” not a business reference call. You don’t know the difference? Neither do I, but in case a manager is criticized for violating company policy, the response can be, “Our company policy prohibits taking business reference calls, and my former employee asked me if I’d take a personal reference call, which is different.” Although we’ve never heard of a former boss being reprimanded or even asked, “Why did you accept that reference call,” this could be the reason given, if asked.

Achieve profitability goals. Budget: (whatever) Competencies: 1. Leadership 2. Integrity 3. Excellence 4. Team Player 5.

This is a vague job description. The president really is most interested in boosting global sales because their #1 global competitor is vulnerable and declining, the VP Manufacturing wants only to keep the domestic plants closer to full capacity, the VP Marketing was hired because patents are running out and the company has no future without new product launches, and of course the VP Finance wants profitable sales.

In our experience, too many companies list too few competencies, rarely define or measure them, and then fire someone for not exhibiting a competency. You have competencies to help reinforce your culture and the performance, but if they are gobbledygook, they don’t help drive performance and they are unfair to individuals.

The problem is this: time! The Topgrading Career History Form is sooo revealing that a hiring manager or HR person can study one completed Form for 15 minutes, and if there are 30 candidates and their 30 completed Forms to read, that’s 30 x 15 minutes = 450 minutes, or omygosh—7.5 hours! Spending almost a day to screen candidates for a job is time well spent because interviewing a bunch of B/C Players will waste a lot more time. And screening candiates from Career History Firms is a heck of a lot more productive that spending hours studying questionably accurate résumés. However, everyone is so busy that no one seems to have a full day to screen résumés/Career History Forms for one job. For years clients have said it would be great if we could devise some way to screen completed Career History Forms faster, but not do it superficially. Would you believe cutting the 7.5 hours to half an hour, saving most of a day? We created the Topgrading Snapshot, the picture (“snapshot,” if you will) of the most important and revealing parts of the Career History Form, and with it you can honestly, accurately, and validly screen candidates in and out in only seconds. That is a super time-saver!

How the Topgrading Snapshot Works: If you recruited from your Networks, when your candidate agrees to spend a day interviewing at your company, that is the time to ask them to complete your application form (the Career History Form).

Competency Interviews overlook too much. Typical competencies for management jobs are Team Player, Passion for Excellence, Integrity, Organization, Leadership, and Judgment. Most competency questions are like the Passion example above—“Give me an example of…”—and the competency was shown or not shown in the response. Another example: “Pat, can you give me an example of a time you were an effective Team Player, and a time you weren’t so good?” The candidate is in total control of the responses, and it’s simple to…um…put one’s “best foot forward.”

In any given moment during an interview, you naturally want to listen carefully to the response to a question, and in doing so you might wonder if further clarification is necessary. If so, you might want to compose an original, probing question, so you need to figure out the wording to it (“try to make it open-ended, don’t bias the response,” and so forth). You perform a quick memory scan, to see if the current response possibly contradicts a previous response. You are trying to tune in to your gut feelings in order to develop the intuitive sense that can only be valid if anchored in facts.

Generally the hiring manager introduces the process and the tandem partner takes over as the principal interviewer for the first half (with the hiring manager taking most of the notes but chiming in with a question or comment periodically). There is a break (drinks, washroom) at about the midpoint. Then the hiring manager becomes the primary interviewer for the more recent (and relevant) half of the chronology, with the tandem taking more voluminous notes and periodically injecting rapport-building comments or asking questions. Finally both ask a few competency questions.

Next ask for every major success and accomplishment, and especially for the jobs in the past decade, dig in and ask how they pulled off successes. Then ask about every significant failure and mistake. Probe to see what lessons were learned from failures, and make a mental note to learn if the same mistakes were repeated in future jobs. Learning about successes and failures, you’ll automatically learn what was liked most and least in a job, but if there is any doubt, ask. High performers tend to have lots of successes and when they tell you how they succeeded, they give you specifics that show their drive, resourcefulness, persistence, and ability to work well with people. And they admit making mistakes…but they learn from them. Low performers are vague about accomplishments, have to be asked again and again about mistakes and failures, tend to blame others and circumstances for those failures, and they tend to make similar mistakes in the future.

Next ask the TORC (Threat of Reference Check) questions (# 6–7), beginning with the candidate’s appraisal of the boss. Later, when you review your notes, you’ll pay a lot of attention to what the candidate liked or disliked in a boss, and whether it is compatible with you, the hiring manager. And realizing that arranging calls with former bosses is the last step before a job offer, the candidate will be remarkably honest in saying what bosses will say are strengths, weaker points, and overall performance.

The logical last question for every job is why they left it. As you would expect, high performers tend to leave jobs because they were promoted, or if they left the employer, they generally were not looking for a job but someone they worked with in the past recruited them for a better position in their company.

I am going to hand you seven critical questions that you need to answer in order to figure out if this guy is capable of looking out for number one—you. Ideally, you’d be able to get answers to these questions before you took a new job, but you didn’t and now you’re working for a manager who isn’t speaking your language. These questions might give you insight into where he’s coming from.

This person has spent their entire career wondering, “When are they going to figure me out?” This paranoia has given them solid information-detection skills , which can be useful to you and your organization. They know when the layoff is coming, they know how to talk to senior management, but they don’t know how to talk to you because you’re actively, passionately doing something they’re clueless about and they believe they have to maintain the appearance they know what they’re doing.

The language you are speaking when you talk to your manager is a flavor of managementese (see Chapter 14 for more on managementese). Yeah, the language that Scott Adams has made millions of dollars exploiting. It is a carefully constructed language that is designed to convey information across the organization. Managementese allows managers from very different parts of the organization to communicate even though their respective jobs are chock-full of different acronyms and proper names.

It’d be great if managers could speak with a little more art, but the job at hand is to spread information across the organization as efficiently as possible. And a local dialect of managementese is the best way. Besides, they still need to talk to you, which leads us to . . .

Managers who don’t have a plan to talk to everyone on their team regularly are deluded. They believe they are going to learn what is going on in their group through some magical organizational osmosis and they won’t. Ideas will not be discovered, talent will be ignored, and the team will slowly begin to believe what they think does not matter, and the team is the company.

Now, me being the director of engineering, you can argue that the onus of action was on me. Problem was, I was doing everything I signed up to do. The VP wasn’t. He wasn’t talking with the CEO about our new plans. He wasn’t handling the other director who was totally checked out, sleeping on the job. When the third follow-up meeting was scheduled, the VP again demonstrated his solid problem-solving skills, but I wasn’t listening anymore.

When the promotion came and it was some engineering manager from an acquired company we’d never heard of, heads were scratched. Until that time, the core engineering team at Netscape was a private club. We’d expected one of our long-time proven managers to the lead the effort. Nope, Mike the New Guy got it and, in a week, he went from no name to the hottest ticket on Middlefield Road.

The organization’s view of your manager is their view of you. I’m glad you’re a C++ rock star, but the problem is, your manager is a passive non-communicator who doesn’t take the time to grok the political intrigue that is created by any large group of people. I see him as a non-factor and you’re living in the shadow of a non-factor.

Getting to pride is usually the end result of a lot of work and a little luck. What you can learn from your manager in this phase is how they’ll deal with that swelling head of theirs. Do they take care of those who got them there? Do they have a plan for what’s next?

A successful organization is built of layers of people that are glued together with managers. Each layer is responsible for a broad task, be it engineering or QA or marketing. Between each layer is a manager whose job it is to translate from one layer to the next . . . in both directions. He knows what his employees want. He knows what his manager wants, and he’s able to successfully navigate when those wants differ.

Being able to relate to those you manage comes from intimately understanding their job. It allows you to speak their language. Question #2: Where am I going? A plan for your manager’s next big move is his incentive. It puts him in the uncomfortable position of trying to discern the murky political motivations of the major influencers of your company. It might not be a skill set he has, but he’s never going to stop trying because he knows where he wants to go. He’s got a map defined by his motivation .

Stables are engineers who: Happily work with direction and appreciate that there appears to be a plan, as well as the calm predictability of a well-defined schedule. Play nicely with others because they value an efficiently run team. Calmly assess risk and carefully work to mitigate failure, however distant or improbable it might be. Tend to generate a lot of process because they know process creates predictably and measurability. Are known for their calm reliability. Volatiles are the engineers who: Prefer to define strategy rather than follow it. Have issues with authority and often have legitimate arguments for anarchy. Can’t conceive of failing, and seek a thrill in risk. See working with others as a time-consuming and onerous task, prefer to work in small, autonomous groups, and don’t give a shit how you feel. Often don’t build particularly beautiful or stable things, but they sure do build a lot. Are only reliable if it’s in their best interest. Leave a trail of disruption in their wake.

Your Stables are there to remind you about reality and to define a process whereby large groups of people can be coordinated to actually get work done. Your Stables bring predictability, repeatability, and credibility to your execution, and you need to build a world where they can thrive. Your Volatiles are there to remind you that nothing lasts, and that the world is full of Volatiles who consider it their mission in life to replace the inefficient, boring, and uninspired. You can’t actually build them a world, because they’ll think you’re up to something Stable, so you need to create a corner of the building where they can disrupt.

We were cleaning up the results of Stephen’s Volatile engineering coup for years, but during that clean-up we went from zero customers to 30. We went from a handful of volatile engineers to a stable company of 200, and this was partly because Stephen gave us a chance to see our platform. But our platform was never done. The boost from Stephen got us out the door, but we were forever in a state of functional incompleteness and architectural inconsistency.

First, this story is incomplete, and you’re OK with that. Here’s why: for now, you need to trust that those who work with you are capable of synthesizing a story. Part of their value is their judgment in presenting you with the essential facts, and until they prove they can’t synthesize well, you assume they can. Second, and contradictorily, while I believe that folks don’t wake up intending to construct lies, I also know that for any story you’re hearing, you’re getting the version that supports their chosen version of reality. As a story is being told to you, the opinion of the storyteller is affecting both the content and the tone. Their agenda dictates what they are choosing to tell you. Again, malevolent forces are not necessarily driving the storyteller. They are hopeful and they want to succeed, but this story needs judgment, and that’s where you come in as a manager.

The best move here is to simply listen and maintain eye contact. Your calmness is a primal attempt to telepathically reflect the insanity back to the freak so they’ll realize they’ve gone off the deep end. This can be rough because the freakout may be pointed directly at you, but even under attack, your job is the same: Listen. Nod. Repeat.

Get the Freaks to Solve Their Own Problems One pleasant side effect of attacking freakouts with questions is that you discover the freak is often already close to a solution. Remember, they’ve been simmering since Friday and, in that time, they’ve been chewing on the problem from every angle possible. In that time, their understanding, while soaked in emotion, has more depth than yours.

There is a basic skill you need whenever you walk into a meeting that has suck potential. This skill is important whether you’re a participant or the person running the meeting. The skill is called agenda detection. Simply put, agenda detection is the ability to discern 1. Typical meeting roles and how meeting participants assume them.   2. Explanation of what these distinct meeting roles want out of a meeting.   3. How to use this understanding to get the hell out of the meeting as quickly as possible.

There are three distinct phases to the mandate: Decide, Deliver, and Deliver (Again). Since you are the ultimate decision maker regarding this particular matter, we’re going to call this a local mandate . These are opposite of foreign mandates, which we’ll talk about later. Let’s begin.

Decide Your first step is to decide when to employ the mandate and to also understand what the consequences are. There are thousands of little tiny decisions you and your team make during the course of a day. A majority of these decisions come and go and no one is the wiser. Every so often, a big decision comes along. Doesn’t matter what the content is, what matters is that some portion of your team is on one side of the decision and another group is on the other side. And they’re arguing.

Sometimes the team is so polarized that they start confusing the emotion with the decision. Rather than arguing the facts, they begin to argue from their heart and that is when you need to consider the mandate. Rule of thumb : When the debate is no longer productive, it’s time to make a decision.

Again, an added benefit of my collaborative management style is that delivering mandates is less controversial because I’ve already vetted the various flavors of the decision with all the folks who have an opinion. When the mandate lands, it feels less like laying down the law and more like I’m relaying the results of our investigation. I still piss off those who disagree with the decision, but they know they were heard.

Bill was a new manager on my team and he was just happy to be attending the staff meeting. My staff meetings are broken into two parts. Part one is the recital of all the information I’ve gotten from my boss’s staff meeting combined with my thoughts and opinions. Part two is quick status and relevant bits from each of the folks in the team. There is a lot of redundancy in part one. How are products doing, who has been promoted, what were the latest customer wins. If you listened to it each week, you’d be bored, but I recite the same thing. Every week. Bill picked up on the boring immediately and stopped taking notes during part one. When I asked him about it, he said, “I don’t think my team cares about customer wins for a product they’re not responsible for.” “Really? Why don’t you ask them?” The following week Bill was furiously taking notes. His comment: “Yeah, they want to hear it all.” Especially in larger organizations, you need to pay careful attention to maintaining a consistent flow of organization information.

At an organizational size that varies for every team, natural cross-pollination and communication activities that used to happen organically, that allowed for cultural and strategic work to get done, and that allowed for big decisions to be made, can no longer occur.

Off-sites don’t need to be swank, but they do need a sense of elsewhere. They need to be far from the tactical distractions of the office because people need a new view. One of your goals for an off-site is to create grounds where people feel comfortable speaking heresy. If whatever problem sitting in front of you could have been solved via the day-to-day, it would have been solved. Drastic measures call for creative thinking, and now that you’ve gathered these bright people together, you want them to feel comfortable saying whatever compelling ideas cross their minds.

The Taker of Notes reads like an administrative job, but it’s the most important gig in the room. Once an off-site really gets going, once the team really engages, it’s all going to sound like great ideas. The Taker of Notes is tasked with not only capturing the bright ideas, but the right ideas. After years of off-sites, my observation is that you only find three new ideas that you act upon. These can be huge company-changing ideas, but there are only going to be three, and it’s the immense burden of the Taker of Notes to not only find them, but assign them to the people who can and will drive them forward.

No Personality Tests, No Trust Falls, and No Outsiders There are a couple of traditional moves that well-intentioned folks who have attended off-sites elsewhere are going to suggest, but that I want you to avoid. Avoid personality tests . If you’re working the team-bonding off-site, personality tests are going to be tempting. The idea of starting the off-site with perspective-altering personality tests feels . . . right. I want them to better understand each other, so have them answer a bunch of questions, and we’ll explain ourselves to each other and—wham!—understanding.

The successful off-site is one that maps the discoveries of the off-site to the reality of the work. Bright-and-shiny inflection points are full of energy, but unless that energy is carefully channeled back into the building and immediately acted upon, all an off-site represents is a frustrating opportunity to dream, but not to act.

Resumes , in their current form, I hope, are not far behind. It’s convenient to have a brief overview of someone’s career when we sit down to interview, but more often than not, when I’m interviewing you, I’m searching Google for more substance. Do you have any sort of digital footprint? A blog? A GitHub repository? It’s these types of artifacts that give me the beginning of insight into who you are. It’s by no means a complete picture, but it’s far more revealing than a bunch of tweets stitched together in a resume.

Management is a myth, just like the top hat. We, as employees, believe it’s there, so we treat these management types differently. We operate under the assumption that they are the ones who can make decisions. When the team is stuck on a hard problem, we gather in our manager’s office, present our case, and then the manager nods and says, “Go that way!” More often than not, we’re so happy to be past the hard problem, we don’t even question whether it’s the right decision or not. “He’s got the top hat, so he must be right!” No no no no. Also? No.

Having no clue where to start a new project and wanting to rip someone apart in e-mail share one important characteristic. The best move in both cases is to start with a good long soak. I break soaking activities into two buckets: active soaks and passive soaks. The active soaks are activities that you can direct and usually involve gathering content, whereas passive soaks are activities when you just point your brain in a random direction and pray. Passive soaks are where the real work gets done—provided you laid the groundwork with an active soak.

It’s a hard question to effectively answer when people are yelling, but phenomenal answers sound like this: We need to demonstrate to this customer that we are capable of exceeding their expectations. We need the people who depend on us to trust that their faith in us is not misplaced. We need the planet Earth to understand that we aren’t evil. You will notice that none of these answers read “unfuck the situation.” When the sky is falling, as I’ve said before, immediate action feels like precisely the right course of action, because, HELLO, THE SKY IS FALLING. But there is a well-defined reason for this situation, and it’s likely you won’t know the reason for a while. It’s agonizing, but my advice is to not make any decisions on a course of action until you have at least a credible answer to this question. In the face of disaster, it’s the wise person who does not act until they know. Unfucking the situation is a bandage. Understanding what you’re truly trying to fix is a cure.

This is because reasonable people are not barbarians, and they are not hackers. They appreciate the predictable, profitable, and knowable world that comes with a well-defined process, and I would like to thank each and every one of them because these people keep the trains running and on time. No one likes barbarians because the barbarian strategy is one at odds with civilization. By definition, a barbarian, a hacker, is building on a strategy that is at odds with the majority.

Part of your credibility as a leader is your public and repeated declaration that it’s your job to help your team succeed, but you have another task: you need to keep building stuff. I’ve gone back and forth on whether managers should code, and my opinion is: don’t stop coding. Each week that passes where you don’t share the joy, despair, and discovery of software development is a week when you slowly forget what it means to be a software developer. Over time it means you’ll have a harder time talking to engineers because you’ll forget how they think and how they become bored.

There are two major things to be wary of with your anchor. First, make sure they know their job. For standing meetings with the usual suspects, the role is obvious, but for one-time meetings, you can’t assume the anchor knows it’s all about them. A clear agenda that anoints the anchor right out of the gate is the best way to make sure everyone knows who the decision maker is. Second, you’ve got to know what to do when there is no anchor present. You’re 15 minutes in and you know the senior VP who is actually going to help here is not present. Sure, there are eight other people here that like to talk, but the best move is a reschedule. You’re wasting time.

I have a simple way of managing against the Fez effect. I tell everyone I hire the same thing: “I hired you because you’ve got enough skill and enough will to have my job one day . . . whether you want it or not.” This statement tells those I work with that I expect them to succeed and reminds me to keep moving because there is nothing like having bright people nipping at your heels to keep you running.

So do I! Where do you surf?” These pleasantries appear trivial, but they’re a big deal to me because I want to see if we can communicate. It’s nowhere near a deal killer if the pacing of our conversation is awkward, I’ll adjust, but how off is it? Are we five minutes in and we still haven’t said anything? OK, maybe we have a problem.

A recent study measuring the impact of an increase in the talent pool on the US economy between 1960 and 2008 found that aggregate output per worker had grown by 15 to 20 percent due to an improved allocation of talent. For example, while in 1960 the effective talent pool for doctors and lawyers consisted of white men—94 percent of all doctors and lawyers in the United States were white men—this had changed dramatically by 2008, when the fraction of white male doctors and lawyers had decreased to 62 percent. Casting the net more widely, including women and African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native Americans, had paid off.

On a micro-level, women have been found to put money to more productive use than men in several cases. In Ivory Coast, for example, there are “male” and “female” crops. Men grow coffee, cocoa, and pineapple; women grow plantains, bananas, coconuts, and vegetables. In years where the men’s crops have high yields, research shows, households spend more money on alcohol and tobacco. When the women have good harvests, in contrast, more money is spent on food.

This fear of trying new things and failing is a real constraint. It is also the one that I had underestimated most. Learning is my business and, naively, I expected everyone to be keen on uncovering past mistakes and improving their decision making. However, in some organizations, acknowledging past errors is risky. Thus, while the CEO or the president might be enthusiastic about discovering mistakes and piloting a new idea, managers at all levels might well feel threatened. To circumvent this, governments and corporations must create safe spaces for experimentation where mistakes are taken as an opportunity to learn.

Our minds are not well equipped to deal with what is commonly known as survivor bias. We constantly make inferences based on biased samples. The archetypal example is a study of World War II bombers. With the hope of making them safer, the planes were examined for weaknesses after they returned from their bombing runs. But, of course, these were the wrong planes to examine. They were just the ones that made it back. To learn about weaknesses, one would have had to examine all the planes—or, as Abraham Wald, a mathematician at Columbia University, concluded at the time, the scientists should not have looked for the bullet holes the returning planes had, but for the bullet holes they did not have. It was these other “holes” that determined whether a plane made it back or not.

About one third of all surgeons in the United States are female, so it is not that surprising that when we think of “surgeon” we also first think “man.” Economists refer to this as statistical discrimination.

To what degree a society wants to allow the use of demographic characteristics to prejudge people is a political, even a moral decision. As a society, we want our systems, laws, and organizational procedures to reflect our values. Accordingly, in many countries it is considered immoral and often illegal to base hiring decisions, for example, on information the employer has about the group a person belongs to. Equality, whether between men and women or between people of different racial, ethnic, national, or other demographic backgrounds, is a moral decision first.18

Evidence from behavioral decision research suggests that we do not update our stereotypes accordingly. In fact, when we think about a group, we do not even focus on the average, as suggested by statistical discrimination, but rather we recall the group’s most distinctive types. We are influenced by salient representatives of a given category. Arguing this point, a recent article provides a helpful illustration: Pause now and think briefly of people living in Florida.

Thus, the relative frequency of the elderly living in Florida is higher than in the comparison group, the rest of the United States. Such stereotypes are based on representative characteristics of a group, not on its average ones.

The effect is even more pronounced with red, blue, green, and so on. Your mind cannot help but read the word first; then it automatically determines the semantic meaning of what it sees: when you read black, you think black. That’s your System 1 at work, and it works very nicely in the first example. However, in the second example your System 2 has to come to System 1’s aid to disentangle the letters from the colors.

Men had an inflated recollection of their past performance, overestimating it by about 30 percent; women also remembered their past performance as higher than it actually was, but by only about 14 percent. Based on these self-assessments, men were more likely to be chosen by their groups. Choosing the wrong leader had consequences. As you might expect, actual past performance was a much better predictor of future performance than the students’ memories, most especially the male students’ inflated recollection.

Successful unfreezing happens when people start to question their current strategies and become curious about alternatives. Experiencing one’s own biases, in an IAT for example, can be one such wake-up call. You should start your trainings with an unfreezing exercise. Unfreezing was also the goal of the previous chapter. By experiencing some of our own biases and learning that we are all in this together, we become curious about what went wrong, why, and what we might be able to do about it.

The participants were presented with a request from a job candidate setting out a number of demands. The job candidate was given a gender-neutral name.

For gender diversity to increase group performance you need team members whose different perspectives add value while keeping the cost of coordination as low as possible. Indeed, diversity theories in organizational behavior, psychology, sociology, and economics expect performance to improve the more diversity is based on different sets of competencies relevant to the task. The more relevant knowledge increases with each additional team member, the more positive the impact. In contrast, the more differences are based on categories not related to the task at hand or on deeply held values, the more diversity is expected to hurt team performance. Of course, variables can interact in many different ways and correcting for most of them is challenging. In certain fields, these differences can even prove insurmountable.12

t sheet of group formation: If a task involves coordination, say the provision of a public good like clean water or better health care, homogenous groups can be helpful. All-women teams, for example, outperformed mixed and all-male teams in Friend or Foe because they correctly believed that women would be more likely to cooperate than men, leading to a virtuous cycle. If a task involves individual problem-solving, say test-taking, be aware of peer effects. Diversity might produce spillovers (or, more formally, “externalities”) affecting, for example, how students perform in a class. If one group is more likely to work hard or disrupt less, as has been found to be true of girls, having them over-represented can help others, in this case boys, perform better. If the task involves collective problem-solving, say the building of a house, you should go for heterogenous groups where the individual knowledge and perspectives of group members complement each other. A particularly useful skill to incorporate in groups is listening and bridge-building, both shown to be correlated with the fraction of women present. And to reduce the challenges associated with social category diversity, you need to make sure demographic minorities are represented by a critical mass of members. If you start out with a population of, say, 20 percent men and 80 percent women and then want to create work teams, do not allocate people proportionally. Instead, form a few balanced teams and assign the rest of the women to all-female groups. D

The short answer is that based on the available data, it is almost impossible to prove either way. No study to date has been able to establish a causal relationship between corporate board diversity and company performance. Boards are not created randomly nor imposed on firms randomly.

Their beauty is that they change numbers quickly, sparing the team the stereotyping and painful assimilation processes that go along with a more incremental approach, which can depress performance.

The composition of groups clearly matters. And while getting it right is not easy, some behavioral design principles can help us move in the right direction. The most important one is critical mass. When forming diverse teams, make sure every subgroup is represented by at least three people or makes up about a third of the total. When you next appraise the performance of your team members, take a moment to reflect on this. Women have been found to receive lower-quality performance evaluations than men in work groups where they compose less than 20 percent of the group.

We sometimes refer to this as herding behavior: the behavior of others, the herd, informs us as to what is normal, appropriate, or beneficial to do. And we then do likewise.

When we informed them about a session where most employers had chosen majority-female teams for both math and verbal tasks, men reacted by choosing fewer women. Under that condition, about 70 percent chose majority-male teams, in both the math and the verbal tasks! The nudge had moved them in the wrong direction and cost women 10 percentage points in the math task and 30 percentage points in the verbal task. In contrast, when we informed male employers about a session where most employers had chosen majority-male teams, not much happened. Neither did anything happen for female employers. On average, women pretty much chose male and female employees equally, independent of the information provided.

Such male defense of the status quo is not unprecedented. After all, we are in a zero-sum world. Increasing the fraction of one gender in a team means decreasing the share of the other gender—unless one can make the team bigger.

As has happened in other companies with gender diversity goals, many men were not excited about this prospect. They saw, quite literally, their slice of the middle and upper management pie shrinking in front of their eyes. German journalists wrote about “discrimination of men,” the “battle of the sexes,” and asked “where to put the men.”8 Thus, male resistance to interventions favoring women is real, whether in the laboratory, in corporate offices, and, maybe, even in board rooms.

Just as learning about what others do can make us want to follow the herd or even outperform it, learning what is approved or sanctioned, either formally by law or informally by social norms, also provides information on what acceptable behavior is. The law, thus, often goes beyond deterrence; it also has an “expressive function.”

that sponsorship might be even more effective than mentorship. In 2008 and 2010 surveys of more than 4,000 employees, all 1996 to 2007 graduates of top MBA programs from around the world, Catalyst found that women were slightly more likely than men to have mentors. But they had different sorts of mentors than did men—less senior, with less organizational clout. In addition, the female employees’ mentors tended to coach and advise them while the men’s mentors took on a more active role and became advocates for their protégés, actively helping them advance their careers. They went beyond mentoring and into active sponsorship. Sponsors make sure their protégés get visibility and are considered for promising opportunities. They negotiate on their behalf for interesting job assignments, promotions, and pay increases. Sponsors either vicariously or directly benefit from their protégés’ successes.

Fostering an atmosphere that doesn’t allow for error simply makes people defensive. They don’t try things that may turn out badly. You encourage this defensiveness when you try to systematize the process, when you impose rigid methodologies so that staff members are not allowed to make any of the key strategic decisions lest they make them incorrectly.

The Spanish Theory of Value is alive and well among managers everywhere. You see that whenever they talk about productivity. Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay. There is a large difference. The Spanish Theory managers dream of attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime. They divide whatever work is done in a week by forty hours, not by the eighty or ninety hours that the worker actually put in.

Although your staff may be exposed to the message “work longer and harder” while they’re at the office, they’re getting a very different message at home. The message at home is, “Life is passing you by. Your laundry is piling up in the closet, your babies are uncuddled, your spouse is starting to look elsewhere. There is only one time around on this merry-go-round called life, only one shot at the brass ring. And if you use your life up on C++ .

Once that idea is digested, the worker is lost forever after to the project. The realization that one has sacrificed a more important value (family, love, home, youth) for a less important value (work) is devastating. It makes the person who has unwittingly sacrificed seek revenge. He doesn’t go to the boss and explain calmly and thoughtfully that things have to change in the future—he just quits, another case of burnout. One way or the other, he’s gone.

Productivity has to be defined as benefit divided by cost. The benefit is observed dollar savings and revenue from the work performed, and cost is the total cost, including replacement of any workers used up by the effort.

Fragmentation is bad for team formation, but it’s also bad for efficiency. (Perhaps you’ve begun to pick up a trend here.) People can keep track of only so many human interactions. When they try to be part of four working groups, they have four times as many interactions to track. They spend all their time changing gears.

The best success is the one in which there is no evident management, in which the team works as a genial aggregation of peers. The best boss is the one who can manage this over and over again without the team members knowing they’ve been “managed.” These bosses are viewed by their peers as just lucky. Everything seems to break right for them. They get a fired-up team of people, the project comes together quickly, and everyone stays enthusiastic through the end. These managers never break into a sweat. It looks so easy that no one can believe they are managing at all.

If you could effect some change in the people you manage and make them much more productive and goal-directed but also less controllable, would you do it? The answer to this question distinguishes the great managers from the merely mediocre. The mediocre manager is too insecure to give up the trappings. The great manager knows that people can’t be controlled in any meaningful sense anyway. The essence of successful management is to get everyone pulling in the same direction and then somehow get them fired up to the point that nothing, not even their manager, could stop their progress.

The violation of property rights, then, is nearly always seen by libertarians as an authoritarian intrusion, both morally and legally illegitimate. Such violations are regarded as coercion, in the special libertarian sense of the term.

By contrast, so-called “VICTIMLESS CRIMES,” cannot properly be grounds for arrest in a libertarian society. If you use drugs (and do not physically injure anyone else in the process), watch pornography, sell products some people like and others don't, or have sex for money, and the only person complaining about these exchanges is the police officer, the politician, or some other third party who disapproves of your actions but whose body or other property was not damaged by those actions, there are no legitimate grounds for legal retaliation against you.

This does not mean that drugs are harmless, or that we should be indifferent to the cases of addiction that do arise. However, just as we have found ways to discourage reckless alcohol consumption without jailing every drinker, so there are a number of voluntary methods at our disposal to deal with drug abuse—addiction counseling, psychotherapy, social pressure from friends and family, professional pressure from employers and co-workers, and moral and religious pressure throughout society. All of those methods would still exist under libertarian principles, plus more. In a society in which people are free to enter into whatever contracts they choose so long as they do not harm third parties, those who fear temptation of any kind could be encouraged to enter into strict, legally binding agreements that impose harsh penalties for straying.

By contrast, the period of relatively increased “globalization” and trade in the decade or two around the collapse of European Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s saw the number of people on Earth who live in absolute poverty cut roughly in half, from about two billion to one billion. That still left a billion too many people in dire poverty, but it gave clear evidence that trade, not government control, is the best route out.

The law, when it's being useful (and libertarian) keeps people from harming each other, but it does very little to keep people sane or to keep them from smashing things they own. That just isn't a very common desire. In general, law—as opposed to spontaneous, personal advice tailored to nuanced local situations—should deal primarily with common social problems, such as reckless driving, pickpocketing, or breaking and entering. Regardless of one's political philosophy, it is probably unwise to build a system of law around rare, strange scenarios such as the wasteful purchaser-and-burner of trees. Such a character is not likely to be a frequent problem. Like many other odd behaviors, this one can probably be safely tolerated by a free society, even if it makes little sense to most of us. That's the usual libertarian solution.

In economic terms, this means that “values are subjective”—not in the sense that phrase is sometimes used, as in moral rules being arbitrary.

Instead, each trade is a case of mutually beneficial exchange. In all of libertarian theory, mutually beneficial exchange is perhaps the single most important idea for understanding social reality. Rather than a world in which there is a fixed quantity of already-distributed goods—and a fixed, unchanging amount of happiness—the possibility of mutually beneficial exchange posits a world in which constant trading between billions of ever-changing pairs of individuals or parties can make everyone better off than they were the moment before the trade.

In reality, libertarians argue, government interferes with trade—resulting in a reduction in overall happiness—virtually every time it acts (with the possible exception of its purely defensive, rights-protecting functions). In essence, government, despite its appearance of having thousands of functions, really does only two things: forbid people from making the trades they want, and force them to make trades they don't want.

Another way of looking at the problem is to think of it as what the twentieth-century ecologist Garrett Hardin called “the tragedy of the commons.” Hardin was no libertarian, but he identified an economic dilemma central to libertarian thinking: the fact that things held in common, owned by everyone and no one, will tend to get used inefficiently, often overused or under-maintained, with each user (intentionally or not) being slightly more likely to shirk the duties of maintenance and hope the next person will take care of it.

“comparative advantage.” That is, it is most efficient for humanity as a whole if goods tend to be produced by those most adept at creating them (as judged by purchasers balancing cost and quality). This may mean that some nations (or companies) simply leave cloth-making or shipbuilding to others and purchase the goods from them. Just as each of us would be unimaginably poor (and probably soon dead) if we each tried to make all our own lightbulbs, medicine, or food from scratch, so too each nation is impoverished if—because of its own trade barriers or those erected by others nations—it has to do everything itself.

Bastiat helped to popularize criticism of what is now known as the “broken window fallacy” in economics: the dangerous belief that if work is created by destroying something (or making some task more difficult) it is a net benefit to humanity. As Bastiat recognized, work may be created for window-makers by smashing windows (or for hand-loom operators by limiting which products can legally be made in modern textile factories, as India does), but the resources poured into window repair could otherwise have been spent on more productive activities, such as buying clothing, art, or oats for horses. Make-work projects merely divert time and money from the things which people would really have valued most.

Anarcho-capitalists, however, might respond that conventional anarchists should simply imagine a world entirely devoid of government, such as both factions want, and ask themselves what rules of conduct they would recommend to the inhabitants of the new anarchist world. Does an individual in that world have the right to respond to personal assault with sufficient force to defend himself? Does he have a right to manipulate some portion of the material world without having to plead with the mob each time before undertaking an action? If so, it appears that our hypothetical inhabitant of the anarchist future has de facto property rights. It appears that, as posited at the outset of this book, he has the right to defend himself from assault, theft, and fraud. And if we agree on that and allow him to collaborate with other willing individuals to use and defend his rights, we have all become anarcho-capitalists.

We are talking about a mass power organization which will change the world into a place where all men and women walk erect, in the spirit of that credo of the Spanish Civil War, ‘Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.’ This means revolution.

Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.

It is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell a product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It’s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are competing with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to train German shepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market and competition shrink, making it less expensive to reach your customers and easier to charge premium pricing.

Conflict is another bad word in the general opinion.

The second influence is probably the most subversive and insidious one, and it has permeated the American scene in the last generation: that is Madison Avenue public relations, middle-class moral hygiene, which has made of conflict or controversy something negative and undesirable. This has all been part of an Advertising Culture that emphasizes getting along with people and avoiding friction.

I have improvised teaching approaches. For example, knowing that one can only communicate and understand in terms of one’s experience, we had to construct experience for our students. Most people do not accumulate a body of experience. Most people go through life undergoing a series of happenings, which pass through their systems undigested. Happenings become experiences when they are digested, when they are reflected on, related to general patterns, and synthesized.

Irreverence. Curiosity and irreverence go together. Curiosity cannot exist without the other. Curiosity asks, “Is this true?” “Just because this has always been the way, is this the best or right way of life, the best or right religion, political or economic value, morality?” To the questioner nothing is sacred. He detests dogma, defies any finite definition of morality, rebels against any repression of a free, open search for ideas no matter where they may lead. He is challenging, insulting, agitating, discrediting. He stirs unrest. As with all life, this is a paradox, for his irreverence is rooted in a deep reverence for the enigma of life, and an incessant search for its meaning.

Another maxim in effective communication is that people have to make their own decisions. It isn’t just that Moses couldn’t tell God what God should do; no organizer can tell a community, either, what to do. Much of the time, though, the organizer will have a pretty good idea of what the community should be doing, and he will want to suggest, maneuver, and persuade the community toward that action. He will not ever seem to tell the community what to do; instead, he will use loaded questions.

One of the factors that changes what you can and can’t communicate is relationships. There are sensitive areas that one does not touch until there is a strong personal relationship based on common involvements. Otherwise the other party turns off and literally does not hear, regardless of whether your words are within his experience. Conversely, if you have a good relationship, he is very receptive, and your “message” comes through in a positive context.

It is what was implicit in the reputed statement of that organizational genius Samuel Adams, at the time when he was allegedly planning the Boston Massacre; he was quoted as saying that there ought to be no less than three or four killed so that we will have martyrs for the Revolution, but there must be no more than ten, because after you get beyond that number we no longer have martyrs but simply a sewage problem.

This element of the specific that must be small enough to be grasped by the hands of experience ties very definitely into the whole scene of issues. Issues must be able to be communicated. It is essential that they can be communicated. It is essential that they be simple enough to be grasped as rallying or battle cries. They cannot be generalities like sin or immorality or the good life or morals. They must be this immorality of this slum landlord with this slum tenement where these people suffer.

The answers to these questions must be acceptable in terms of the experience of the community. If the organizer begins with an affirmation of his love for people, he promptly turns everyone off. If, on the other hand, he begins with a denunciation of exploiting employers, slum landlords, police shakedowns, gouging merchants, he is inside their experience and they accept him. People can make judgments only on the basis of their own experiences. And the question in their minds is, “If we were in the organizer’s position, would we do what he is doing and if so, why?” Until they have an answer that is at least somewhat acceptable they find it difficult to understand and accept the organizer.

To do otherwise would be to stifle organization and action, for what the organizer accepts as uncertainty would be seen by them as a terrifying chaos.

Until he has developed that mass power base, he confronts no major issues. He has nothing with which to confront anything. Until he has those means and power instruments, his “tactics” are very different from power tactics.

That it was all about the tech. But selling porn taught me that the raison d’être for any business is to give the customer what he wants. He doesn’t want the tech; he wants what the tech can deliver.

“Failure is not an option” is one of the most beloved mantras of gurus everywhere. It is a fallacy. Failure is not a choice: it is an outcome. That outcome may come about as a result of your mistakes; or it may come about as a result of events outside your control. Either way, making the right choices about how to handle that failure is a crucial step to ultimate business success. The trick is not to act like failure is not an option—the trick is to know when failure is the right option.

TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE “FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION” FALLACY Plan for failure. Don’t expect to fail—but do expect that you might fail. Learn about the process of closing down a business: how to do it fairly and efficiently. Set negative targets: if you hit these, despite your best efforts, then you automatically trigger your failure plan and start winding down the company. Failing this way means you’re more likely to retain the loyalty of your colleagues and the respect of your clients and customers. And that makes you more likely to bounce back and succeed the next time.

The Idea Fallacy is the belief that inspiration, not perspiration, is the fount of creative success, whether in the arts, the creative industries, or in startups. It is the belief that the root of success lies in the idea rather than the execution—the belief that ideas have substantial intrinsic value—that they are the key item in the startup value chain.

Rarely is an idea original. Society’s focus on the “Big Idea” is misplaced. As Jim Collins shows in Great by Choice, many of our business icons build their success on the back of other people’s ideas: it wasn’t the McDonald brothers who built McDonald’s into an empire, it was Ray Kroc who saw the seed of greater success in their operation and bought it from them.

TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE IDEA FALLACY Don’t be seduced by the brilliance of your idea—or anybody else’s. Test it on the market: if it works, develop it. If it doesn’t, move on. If there are already competitors with the same idea and they’re thriving, that proves there’s a market. Take it on. Share your ideas—don’t hoard them. An idea that you’re never going to execute could be the seed of somebody else’s success—and help make the ecosystem better for everyone.

If you have skills they can use, sell them. Use those skills to get inside other corporate and creative environments so you can learn from other people’s mistakes before you have to learn from your own. When you want to build your own scalable startup, build it on the foundation of your services business. It will be stronger and more nimble, and you’ll have a cushion if it collapses.

It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are tragic expressions of our own values and needs. They are tragic because when we express our values and needs in this form, we increase defensiveness and resistance among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us.

It is important here not to confuse value judgments and moralistic judgments. All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, freedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served. We make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments; for example, “Violence is bad. People who kill others are evil.”

the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves—to outside authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad. When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.

Summary It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately. We have, however, learned many forms of life-alienating communication that lead us to speak and behave in ways that injure others and ourselves. One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who don’t act in harmony with our values. Another is the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for others and for ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires in the form of demands is yet another characteristic of language that blocks compassion.

Stage 2: In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of assuming responsibility for others’ feelings and trying to accommodate them at our own expense. When we notice how much of our lives we’ve missed and how little we have responded to the call of our own soul, we may get angry.

Stage 3: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame. Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those who receive our efforts. We accept full responsibility for our own intentions and actions, but not for the feelings of others.

When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly important. When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm. They are likewise negatively affected by a declarative tone that implies that we are telling them what is going on inside of them. If we are consciously listening for other people’s feelings and needs, however, our tone communicates that we’re asking whether we have understood—not claiming that we have understood.

If we do something stimulated solely by the urge to avoid shame, we will generally end up detesting it.

(5) TO AVOID GUILT In other instances, we may think, “If I don’t do this, people will be disappointed in me.” We are afraid we’ll end up feeling guilty for failing to fulfill other people’s expectations of us. There is a world of difference between doing something for others in order to avoid guilt and doing it out of a clear awareness of our own need to contribute to the happiness of other human beings. The first is a world filled with misery; the second is a world filled with play.

(6) TO SATISFY A SENSE OF DUTY When we use language which denies choice (for example, words such as should, have to, ought, must, can’t, supposed to, etc.), our behaviors arise out of a vague sense of guilt, duty, or obligation.

For those of you wishing to apply NVC, especially in challenging situations of anger, I would suggest the following exercise. As we have seen, our anger comes from judgments, labels, and thoughts of blame, of what people “should” do and what they “deserve.” List the judgments that float most frequently in your head by using the cue, “I don’t like people who are … ” Collect all such negative judgments in your head and then ask yourself, “When I make that judgment of a person, what am I needing and not getting?” In this way, you train yourself to frame your thinking in terms of unmet needs rather than in terms of judgments of other people.

On the other hand, we have a different kind of reformer who never calls himself one. He is singularly like the radical reformer. The radical has had no experience and does not want it.

It is very easy, unless one keeps a plan thoroughly in mind, to get burdened with money and then, in an effort to make more money, to forget all about selling to the people what they want. Business on a money-making basis is most insecure. It is a touch-and-go affair, moving irregularly and rarely over a term of years amounting to much. It is the function of business to produce for consumption and not for money or speculation.

Start with an article that suits and then study to find some way of eliminating the entirely useless parts. This applies to everything—a shoe, a dress, a house, a piece of machinery, a railroad, a steamship, an airplane. As we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones we also cut down the cost of making. This is simple logic, but oddly enough the ordinary process starts with a cheapening of the manufacturing instead of with a simplifying of the article.

Lack of knowledge of what is going on and lack of knowledge of what the job really is and the best way of doing it are the reasons why farming is thought not to pay. Nothing could pay the way farming is conducted. The farmer follows luck and his forefathers. He does not know how economically to produce, and he does not know how to market. A manufacturer who knew how neither to produce nor to market would not long stay in business. That the farmer can stay on shows how wonderfully profitable farming can be.

I do not believe in letting any good idea get by me, but I will not quickly decide whether an idea is good or bad. If an idea seems good or seems even to have possibilities, I believe in doing whatever is necessary to test out the idea from every angle. But testing out the idea is something very different from making a change in the car. Where most manufacturers find themselves quicker to make a change in the product than in the method of manufacturing—we follow exactly the opposite course.

1. An absence of fear of the future and of veneration for the past. One who fears the future, who fears failure, limits his activities. Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again. There is no disgrace in honest failure; there is disgrace in fearing to fail.

The most surprising feature of business as it was conducted was the large attention given to finance and the small attention to service. That seemed to me to be reversing the natural process which is that the money should come as the result of work and not before the work. The second feature was the general indifference to better methods of manufacture as long as whatever was done got by and took the money.

My idea was then and still is that if a man did his work well, the price he would get for that work, the profits and all financial matters, would care for themselves and that a business ought to start small and build itself up and out of its earnings.

A good business was not one that did good work and earned a fair profit. A good business was one that would give the opportunity for the floating of a large amount of stocks and bonds at high prices. It was the stocks and bonds, not the work, that mattered. I could not see how a new business or an old business could be expected to be able to charge into its product a great big bond interest and then sell the product at a fair price. I have never been able to see that.

Money is not worth a particular amount. As money it is not worth anything, for it will do nothing of itself. The only use of money is to buy tools to work with or the product of tools. Therefore money is worth what it will help you to produce or buy and no more. If a man thinks that his money will earn 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, he ought to place it where he can get that return, but money placed in a business is not a charge on the business—or, rather, should not be. It ceases to be money and becomes, or should become, an engine of production, and it is therefore worth what it produces—and not a fixed sum according to some scale that has no bearing upon the particular business in which the money has been placed. Any return should come after it has produced, not before.

The man who has the largest capacity for work and thought is the man who is bound to succeed. I cannot pretend to say, because I do not know, whether the man who works always, who never leaves his business, who is absolutely intent upon getting ahead, and who therefore does get ahead—is happier than the man who keeps office hours, both for his brain and his hands. It is not necessary for any one to decide the question. A ten-horsepower engine will not pull as much as a twenty. The man who keeps brain office hours limits his horsepower. If he is satisfied to pull only the load that he has, well and good, that is his affair—but he must not complain if another who has increased his horsepower pulls more than he does. Leisure and work bring different results. If a man wants leisure and gets it—then he has no cause to complain. But he cannot have both leisure and the results of work.

The universal car had to have these attributes: (1) Quality in material to give service in use. Vanadium steel is the strongest, toughest, and most lasting of steels. It forms the foundation and super-structure of the cars. It is the highest quality steel in this respect in the world, regardless of price. (2) Simplicity in operation—because the masses are not mechanics. (3) Power in sufficient quantity. (4) Absolute reliability—because of the varied uses to which the cars would be put and the variety of roads over which they would travel. (5) Lightness. With the Ford there are only 7.95 pounds to be carried by each cubic inch of piston displacement. This is one of the reasons why Ford cars are "always going," wherever and whenever you see them—through sand and mud, through slush, snow, and water, up hills, across fields and roadless plains. (6) Control—to hold its speed always in hand, calmly and safely meeting every emergency and contingency either in the crowded streets of the city or on dangerous roads. The planetary transmission of the Ford gave this control and anybody could work it. That is the "why" of the saying: "Anybody can drive a Ford." It can turn around almost anywhere. (7) The more a motor car weighs, naturally the more fuel and lubricants are used in the driving; the lighter the weight, the lighter the expense of operation.

where complex failures are both inevitable and unpredictable. KRIPA KRISHNAN We’ve learned a few things as well. The most important of those lessons is that an untested disaster recovery plan isn’t really a plan at all. We also know now that if doing something is hard, repetition is going to help make it easier. At Google scale, even if there’s only a fraction of a one-percent chance of a failure occurring, that means it’s a failure likely to occur multiple times. Our plan is to preemptively trigger the failure, observe it, fix it, and then repeat until that issue ceases to be one. In our most recent GameDay exercise, we retested some things that caused serious failures two to three years ago and were pleased to find they can now be resolved effortlessly. We’ve also learned that real success doesn’t come from just running a GameDay test once a year but instead from getting teams to test their services internally all year round. That said, GameDay gives us an opportunity to test some less-exercised links. For example, we design tests that require engineers from several groups who might not normally work together to interact with each other. That way, should a real large-scale disaster ever strike, these people will already have strong working relationships established.

The salient point then is that in our march to simplify reality with useful models, of which Farnam Street is an advocate, we confuse the models with reality. For many people, the model creates its own reality. It is as if the spreadsheet comes to life. We forget that reality is a lot messier. The map isn’t the territory. The theory isn’t what it describes, it’s simply a way we choose to interpret a certain set of information. Maps can also be wrong, but even if they are essentially correct, they are an abstraction, and abstraction means that information is lost to save space. (Recall the mile-to-mile scale map.)

None of our men are "experts." We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert—because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job. A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is. Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the "expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible.

Now a business, in my way of thinking, is not a machine. It is a collection of people who are brought together to do work and not to write letters to one another. It is not necessary for any one department to know what any other department is doing. If a man is doing his work he will not have time to take up any other work. It is the business of those who plan the entire work to see that all of the departments are working properly toward the same end. It is not necessary to have meetings to establish good feeling between individuals or departments. It is not necessary for people to love each other in order to work together. Too much good fellowship may indeed be a very bad thing, for it may lead to one man trying to cover up the faults of another. That is bad for both men. When we are at work we ought to be at work. When we are at play we ought to be at play. There is no use trying to mix the two. The sole object ought to be to get the work done and to get paid for it.

Men will work with the idea of catching somebody's eye; they will work with the idea that if they fail to get credit for what they have done, they might as well have done it badly or not have done it at all. Thus the work sometimes becomes a secondary consideration. The job in hand—the article in hand, the special kind of service in hand—turns out to be not the principal job. The main work becomes personal advancement—a platform from which to catch somebody's eye. This habit of making the work secondary and the recognition primary is unfair to the work. It makes recognition and credit the real job. And this also has an unfortunate effect on the worker. It encourages a peculiar kind of ambition which is neither lovely nor productive. It produces the kind of man who imagines that by "standing in with the boss" he will get ahead.

If men, instead of saying "the employer ought to do thus-and-so," would say, "the business ought to be so stimulated and managed that it can do thus-and-so," they would get somewhere. Because only the business can pay wages. Certainly the employer cannot, unless the business warrants.

But by no means all employers or all employees will think straight. The habit of acting shortsightedly is a hard one to break. What can be done? Nothing. No rules or laws will effect the changes. But enlightened self-interest will. It takes a little while for enlightenment to spread. But spread it must, for the concern in which both employer and employees work to the same end of service is bound to forge ahead in business.

There will never be a system invented which will do away with the necessity of work. Nature has seen to that. Idle hands and minds were never intended for any one of us. Work is our sanity, our self-respect, our salvation. So far from being a curse, work is the greatest blessing. Exact social justice flows only out of honest work. The man who contributes much should take away much. Therefore no element of charity is present in the paying of wages. The kind of workman who gives the business the best that is in him is the best kind of workman a business can have. And he cannot be expected to do this indefinitely without proper recognition of his contribution.

When we are all in the business working together, we all ought to have some share in the profits—by way of a good wage, or salary, or added compensation. And that is beginning now quite generally to be recognized.

A great deal of inequity creeps into wage rates unless both the employer and the employee know that the rate paid has been arrived at by something better than a guess.

It was a sort of prosperity-sharing plan. But on conditions. The man and his home had to come up to certain standards of cleanliness and citizenship. Nothing paternal was intended!—a certain amount of paternalism did develop, and that is one reason why the whole plan and the social welfare department were readjusted.

If you expect a man to give his time and energy, fix his wages so that he will have no financial worries. It pays. Our profits, after paying good wages and a bonus—which bonus used to run around ten millions a year before we changed the system—show that paying good wages is the most profitable way of doing business.

Consider first the fundamentals of prosperity. Progress is not made by pulling off a series of stunts. Each step has to be regulated. A man cannot expect to progress without thinking. Take prosperity. A truly prosperous time is when the largest number of people are getting all they can legitimately eat and wear, and are in every sense of the word comfortable. It is the degree of the comfort of the people at large—not the size of the manufacturer's bank balance—that evidences prosperity.

There are short-sighted men who cannot see that business is bigger than any one man's interests. Business is a process of give and take, live and let live. It is cooperation among many forces and interests. Whenever you find a man who believes that business is a river whose beneficial flow ought to stop as soon as it reaches him you find a man who thinks he can keep business alive by stopping its circulation. He would produce wealth by this stopping of the production of wealth. The principles of service cannot fail to cure bad business. Which leads us into the practical application of the principles of service and finance.
